# MeteOrsago
A weather Android App for my local city. It uses data from a weather station placed on my roof's house. I used technologies I teached myself during my bachelor degree (Recycler views, volley, navigation bars, fragments, ...). Android is always evolving and in future I will switch to Kotling
You can clone this project or you can download the app via this [link](http://meteorsago.altervista.org/swpi/images/meteorsago.apk).
